In addition, VTOLup™ can be synchronized with the VTOLup™ secure website portal accessible through most modern web browsers using the Internet. VTOLup™ collects personally identifiable information, such as your e-mail address, name, home or work address or telephone number. VTOLup™ also collects anonymous demographic information, which is not unique to you, such as type of home and property furnishings, conditions, and usage. There is also information about your computer hardware and software that is automatically collected by VTOLup™. This information can include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring Website addresses. This information is used by VTOLup™ for the operation of the service, to maintain quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the VTOLup™ Website.

          <h4>Use of your Personal Information</h4>
          <p>VTOLup™ collects and uses your personal information to operate the VTOLup™ Website and deliver the services you have requested. VTOLup™ also uses your personally identifiable information to inform you of other products or services available from VTOLup™ and its affiliates. VTOLup™ may also contact you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new services that may be offered. VTOLup™ does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties. VTOLup™ may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your unique personally identifiable information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is not transferred to the third party. In addition, VTOLup™ may share data with trusted partners to help us perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, provide customer support, or arrange for deliveries. All such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services through the VTOLup™ secure website portal, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information. VTOLup™ does not use or disclose sensitive personal information, such as race, religion, or political affiliations, without your explicit consent. VTOLup™ keeps track of the Websites and pages our customers visit within VTOLup™ secure website portal, in order to determine what VTOLup™ services are the most popular. This data is used to deliver customized content and advertising within VTOLup™ to customers whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area. VTOLup™ Websites will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on VTOLup™ or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of VTOLup™; and, (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of VTOLup™, or the public. Your information may be shared with the following individuals for specific purposes that you agree:

          <h4>Use of Cookies</h4>
          <p>The VTOLup™ Website use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize VTOLup™ pages, or register with VTOLup™ site or services, a cookie helps VTOLup™ to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same VTOLup™ Website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the VTOLup™ features that you customized. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. 
            If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the VTOLup™ services or Websites you visit.</p>

VTOLup™ secures the personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other Websites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.
